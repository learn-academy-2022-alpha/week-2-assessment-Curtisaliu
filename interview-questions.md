# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer:
A parameter is a placeholder variable in a function. While the argument can be described as having the real values being passed into a function.

  Researched answer:
A parameter is the placeholder variable that is being defined inside the parentheses of the function expression. The parameters can be described as the names listed in the function. On the other hand, the argument is the actual content passed to the function inside the parentheses of the function call. The values of the argument must be a data type that JavaScript recognizes. In conclusion, the parameter are named variables that act as placeholders, while the argument are the real values being passed to the function.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:
I believe the predefined parameters of .map() are value, index, and array. I believe value is the only one that is required, while the other two are optional. Additionally, the order of the predefined parameters will always be value, index, and array.

  Researched answer:
The predefined parameters are value, index, and array. Thus, it should look like .map(value, index, array). As stated above, value is the only parameter that is required, while both index and array are optional. The parameters can be named arbitrarily, but the order will always be the same.


3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer:
Map will go through an array and return a new array of the same length. While, the filter function will return a new array with only the desired values that is specified in the condition.

  Researched answer:
The map function iterates through an array then creates a new array of the same length. Additionally, map will change/update each element in the original array.
The filter function loops through an array then returns a subset of the given array with the desired values that satisfy the stated condition. The filter array, technically still makes a new array but removes all the unwanted elements that did not fulfill the condition.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:
A function is a set of code that allows the developer to run a task as many times as they desire.
A method is the behavior of the object.

  Researched answer:
A function is a set of code that details in how to perform a specific task. The instructions can be execute an action multiple times until the developer is satisfied.
A method is the property of an object. Essentially a method is a function that is associated with an object.


5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
Destructuring is the process in which allows us to take data from an object and specify them a variables.

  Researched answer:
Object destructuring is a special way of extracting properties from objects/arrays and unpack their values into specified variables.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
I think it has something to do with declarations and variables, but I am unsure of what it does.

  Researched answer:
Essentially, hoisting is the process in which Javascript takes all the declared variables and places them to the top of the file. Thus, when we try to log something, the file can see that we declared the variable somewhere but is unable to find what it was assign too. Therefore, the declaration of the variable still needs to be placed before the console log.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance:
Class inheritance is a feature in which allows a class to inherit all the methods and properties of another class. Thus, allowing the code to be re-usable.  Additionally, the new class can add more methods and properties, unlike the old class.

2. React:
React is a JS library that is a tool for building user interfaces based on UI components.

3. React state:
React state is a built-in react object that is used to contain data/information about the component in which determines how they behave.

4. React lifecycle methods:
Lifecycle methods are special methods that are built-in React, which is used to operate on components throughout their duration in the DOM. There are three categories in a lifecycle method: mounting, updating, and unmounting. When a component renders for the first time, it is considered "mounted."

5. DOM:
DOM is short for Document Object Model which is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. DOM sets a standard for accessing documents in which it allows a platform to be language neutral and provides an interface that allows for dynamic usage of programs to access content.
